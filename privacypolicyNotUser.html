        <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
        <p class="f-size-20">We respect your privacy and are committed to protecting it through our compliance with this
            privacy policy (“Policy”). This Policy describes the types of information we may collect from you or that
            you may provide (“Personal Information”) on the join-46.developerakademie.net/board.html website
            (“Website”), “Join” mobile application (“Mobile Application”), and any of their related products and
            services (collectively, “Services”), and our practices for collecting, using, maintaining, protecting, and
            disclosing that Personal Information. It also describes the choices available to you regarding our use of
            your Personal Information and how you can access and update it.
            <br>
            <br>
            This Policy is a legally binding agreement between you (“User”, “you” or “your”) and Developer Akademie
            (“Developer Akademie”, “we”, “us” or “our”). If you are entering into this Policy on behalf of a business or
            other legal entity, you represent that you have the authority to bind such entity to this Policy, in which
            case the terms “User”, “you” or “your” shall refer to such entity. If you do not have such authority, or if
            you do not agree with the terms of this Policy, you must not accept this Policy and may not access and use
            the Services. By accessing and using the Services, you acknowledge that you have read, understood, and agree
            to be bound by the terms of this Policy. This Policy does not apply to the practices of companies that we do
            not own or control, or to individuals that we do not employ or manage.

        <h2 class="f-size-32" id="collection-of-personal-information">Collection of personal information</h2>
        <p>You can access and use the Services without telling us who you are or revealing any information by which
            someone could identify you as a specific, identifiable individual. If, however, you wish to use some of the
            features offered on the Services, you may be asked to provide certain Personal Information (for example,
            your name and e-mail address).</p>
        <p>We receive and store any information you knowingly provide to us when you create an account, or fill any
            forms on the Services.</p>
        <p>You can choose not to provide us with your Personal Information, but then you may not be able to take
            advantage of some of the features on the Services. Users who are uncertain about what information is
            mandatory are welcome to contact us.</p>
        <h2 class="f-size-32" id="privacy-of-children">Privacy of children</h2>
        <p>We do not knowingly collect any Personal Information from children under the age of 18. If you are under the
            age of 18, please do not submit any Personal Information through the Services. If you have reason to believe
            that a child under the age of 18 has provided Personal Information to us through the Services, please
            contact us to request that we delete that child &#8217;s Personal Information from our Services.</p>
        <p>We encourage parents and legal guardians to monitor their children &#8217;s Internet usage and to help
            enforce
            this Policy by instructing their children never to provide Personal Information through the Services without
            their permission. We also ask that all parents and legal guardians overseeing the care of children take the
            necessary precautions to ensure that their children are instructed to never give out Personal Information
            when online without their permission.</p>
        <h2 class="f-size-32" id="use-and-processing-of-collected-information">Use and processing of collected
            information</h2>
        <p>We act as a data controller and a data processor when handling Personal Information, unless we have entered
            into a data processing agreement with you in which case you would be the data controller and we would be the
            data processor.</p>
        <p>Our role may also differ depending on the specific situation involving Personal Information. We act in the
            capacity of a data controller when we ask you to submit your Personal Information that is necessary to
            ensure your access and use of the Services. In such instances, we are a data controller because we determine
            the purposes and means of the processing of Personal Information.</p>
        <p>We act in the capacity of a data processor in situations when you submit Personal Information through the
            Services. We do not own, control, or make decisions about the submitted Personal Information, and such
            Personal Information is processed only in accordance with your instructions. In such instances, the User
            providing Personal Information acts as a data controller.</p>
        <p>In order to make the Services available to you, or to meet a legal obligation, we may need to collect and use
            certain Personal Information. If you do not provide the information that we request, we may not be able to
            provide you with the requested products or services. Any of the information we collect from you may be used
            to help us run and operate the Services.</p>
        <p>Processing your Personal Information depends on how you interact with the Services, where you are located in
            the world and if one of the following applies: (i) you have given your consent for one or more specific
            purposes; (ii) provision of information is necessary for the performance of this Policy with you and/or for
            any pre-contractual obligations thereof; (iii) processing is necessary for compliance with a legal
            obligation to which you are subject; (iv) processing is related to a task that is carried out in the public
            interest or in the exercise of official authority vested in us; (v) processing is necessary for the purposes
            of the legitimate interests pursued by us or by a third party.</p>
        <p>Note that under some legislations we may be allowed to process information until you object to such
            processing by opting out, without having to rely on consent or any other of the legal bases. In any case, we
            will be happy to clarify the specific legal basis that applies to the processing, and in particular whether
            the provision of Personal Information is a statutory or contractual requirement, or a requirement necessary
            to enter into a contract.</p>
        <h2 class="f-size-32" id="disclosure-of-information">Disclosure of information</h2>
        <p>To maintain the highest level of privacy and to protect your Personal Information to the full extent, we do
            not share your Personal Information with anyone and for any reason.</p>
        <h2 class="f-size-32" id="retention-of-information">Retention of information</h2>
        <p>We will retain and use your Personal Information for the period necessary to comply with our legal
            obligations, to enforce our Policy, resolve disputes, and unless a longer retention period is required or
            permitted by law.</p>
        <p>We may use any aggregated data derived from or incorporating your Personal Information after you update or
            delete it, but not in a manner that would identify you personally. Once the retention period expires,
            Personal Information shall be deleted. Therefore, the right to access, the right to erasure, the right to
            rectification, and the right to data portability cannot be enforced after the expiration of the retention
            period.</p>
        <h2 class="f-size-32" id="do-not-track-signals">Do Not Track signals</h2>
        <p>
            Some browsers incorporate a Do Not Track feature that signals to websites you visit that you do not want to
            have your online activity tracked. Tracking is not the same as using or collecting information in connection
            with a website. For these purposes, tracking refers to collecting personally identifiable information from
            consumers who use or visit a website or online service as they move across different websites over time. How
            browsers communicate the Do Not Track signal is not yet uniform. As a result, the Services are not yet set
            up to interpret or respond to Do Not Track signals communicated by your browser. Even so, as described in
            more detail throughout this Policy, we limit our use and collection of your Personal Information. For a
            description of Do Not Track protocols for browsers and mobile devices or to learn more about the choices
            available to you, visit <a href="https://www.internetcookies.com" target="_blank"

        </p>
        <h2 class="f-size-32" id="links-to-other-resources">Links to other resources</h2>
        <p>The Services contain links to other resources that are not owned or controlled by us. Please be aware that we
            are not responsible for the privacy practices of such other resources or third parties. We encourage you to
            be aware when you leave the Services and to read the privacy statements of each and every resource that may
            collect Personal Information.</p>
        <h2 class="f-size-32" id="information-security">Information security</h2>
        <p>No data transmission over the Internet or wireless network can be guaranteed. Therefore, while we strive to
            protect your Personal Information, you acknowledge that (i) there are security and privacy limitations of
            the Internet which are beyond our control; (ii) the security, integrity, and privacy of any and all
            information and data exchanged between you and the Services cannot be guaranteed; and (iii) any such
            information and data may be viewed or tampered with in transit by a third party, despite best efforts.</p>
        <p>As the security of Personal Information depends in part on the security of the device you use to communicate
            with us and the security you use to protect your credentials, please take appropriate measures to protect
            this information.</p>
        <h2 class="f-size-32" id="data-breach">Data breach</h2>
        <p>In the event we become aware that the security of the Services has been compromised or Users &#8217;Personal
            Information has been disclosed to unrelated third parties as a result of external activity, including, but
            not limited to, security attacks or fraud, we reserve the right to take reasonably appropriate measures,
            including, but not limited to, investigation and reporting, as well as notification to and cooperation with
            law enforcement authorities. In the event of a data breach, we will make reasonable efforts to notify
            affected individuals if we believe that there is a reasonable risk of harm to the User as a result of the
            breach or if notice is otherwise required by law. When we do, we will post a notice on the Services.</p>
        <h2 class="f-size-32" id="changes-and-amendments">Changes and amendments</h2>
        <p>We reserve the right to modify this Policy or its terms related to the Services at any time at our
            discretion. When we do, we will send you an email to notify you. We may also provide notice to you in other
            ways at our discretion, such as through the contact information you have provided.</p>
        <p>An updated version of this Policy will be effective immediately upon the posting of the revised Policy unless
            otherwise specified. Your continued use of the Services after the effective date of the revised Policy (or
            such other act specified at that time) will constitute your consent to those changes. However, we will not,
            without your consent, use your Personal Information in a manner materially different than what was stated at
            the time your Personal Information was collected.</p>
        <h2 class="f-size-32" id="acceptance-of-this-policy">Acceptance of this policy</h2>
        <p>
            You acknowledge that you have read this Policy and agree to all its terms and conditions. By accessing and

            to abide by the terms of this Policy, you are not authorized to access or use the Services. This privacy
            policy has been created with the help of the<a
